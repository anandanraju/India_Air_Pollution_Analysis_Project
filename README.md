# India Air Pollution Analysis Project

## Introduction 

Air pollution is defined as the introduction of pollutants, organic molecules, or other unsafe materials into Earthâ€™s atmosphere.
This can be in the form of excessive gases like carbon dioxide and other vapours that cannot be effectively removed through natural cycles, 
such as the carbon cycle or the nitrogen cycle.

### Here, I mainly focused on the Indian Cities

#### About PM Values

The most common measurement used to measure air quality is PM 2.5 and PM 10. It measures the particles in micrograms per cubic metre. PM 2.5 refers to the concentration of microscopic particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter and PM 10 refers to the concentration of particles less than 10 microns in diameter. 

Across the globe, all the countries use the same metrics for measuring the health of atmospheric air. India measures 2 additional pollutants namely lead and ammonia. AQI value of less than 50 is considered safe.
